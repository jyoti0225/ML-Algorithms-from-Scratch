# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch
In this repository, I will be implementing popular machine learning algorithms right from scratch.

## [1. Decision Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/jyoti0225/ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch/tree/master/Decision%20Tree)</br>
For most of complex and non-linear data , tree based algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc works better than most of the algorithms. But have you ever thought how these algorithms work?<br>
In this, you will understand the working of a Decision Tree and then can also implement it in python using NumPy.


## [2. K-Nearesr Neighbour Algorithm](https://github.com/jyoti0225/ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch/tree/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbor)</br>
In this, we will be implementing KNN-Algorithm from scratch. KNN is a data classification algorithm that attempts to determine what group a data point is in by looking at the data points around it.
